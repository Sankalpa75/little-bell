                        The Commercial Roofing is such a material that is used to seal the roofs of the commercial structures so as to protect them. ... Also popular commercial roofing is the flat roofing.<br><br>

                        The systems available to commercial building owners, the way these systems are installed vary from residential roofing applications. The problems that commercial building owners face and the solutions to their commercial roofing problems also vary from residential roofing applications. Many people don’t realize the differences in residential and commercial roofing applications, but it is important to realize these two industries are not the same, there are differences between them, and they should be handled differently.<br><br>

                        The installation of commercial roofing systems also varies greatly from that of residential roofs. The most significant difference is length of installation. Commercial roofs can take over a month to install, while most residential roofs can be done in a day or two. The increase in time for commercial roofs is partly due to the size of the building, as commercial roofs tend to be larger than residential. Another contributing factor to the time increase during installation is that commercial roofing systems are often more complex and difficult to install. They often require multiple days of waiting for product to cure, settle, be glued, or other time consuming activities.<br><br>
