                        You may have adopted or been given a female kitten, and now that she is a few months older, her behavior has suddenly become suspiciously "amorous." You are wondering could she possibly be in heat already? Yes, you've read about spaying, but haven't yet gotten around to it. Perhaps you're secretly thinking how nice it might be to have a litter of kittens--just one.<br><br>

You love her, though, and you're also wondering if she could become pregnant at her age. What exactly would happen, should she someday slip out the door and encounter a frisky male cat with only one thing on his mind? Give your Cats to us for a safe breeding and a great result that will fill your home with Kittens.
