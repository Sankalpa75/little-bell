                        From curved metal to low slopes, industrial style roofs use geometric shapes and lines to create truly unique designs.  The mixture of straight and curved lines creates visual interest on either commercial or residential buildings.<br><br>

                        Standing seam panels are a popular choice for industrial metal roofing because they can be applied to low slopes and are usually installed with hidden fasteners. These panels can be run over open purlin systems and in long single runs making them very appealing in industrial metal designs for residential and commercial applications. With long, sleek lines, all our standing panels are great options for these designs, however our mechanical locking panels work the best for low slopes.<br><br>
